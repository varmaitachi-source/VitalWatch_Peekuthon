This section focuses on the encryption and decryption mechanisms integrated into the Vital Watch system.

## Highlights
- **AES-128 Encryption:** Implemented at both node and hub levels for end-to-end security.
- **ESP-NOW + AES Hybrid:** Achieves peer-to-peer communication with confidentiality.
- **Device Authentication:** Ensures only registered devices exchange medical data.
- **Test Results:** Encrypted and decrypted data logs are included here.

This ensures that patient data remains protected even in offline or local network modes.
