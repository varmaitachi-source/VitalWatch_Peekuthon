## This directory contains the schematic of the printed circuit board, designed using the EDA software 

Particularly we have added three schematics.

   this image shows the schematic diagram of our vital watch with out its main controller i.e., MCU for which we considered using ESP-32 - WROOM chip. As our watch     stands on communicating through ESP-NOW protocol, we have to use either an ESP32 or ESP8266. We chose ESP32 for its reliabilty, comaptibility and its ability to connect through both bluetooth and WiFi. As you can see in this image that we haven't actually placed a ESP32-WROOM chip
