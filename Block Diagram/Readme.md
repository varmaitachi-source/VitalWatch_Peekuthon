# Block Diagrams

This section provides the hardware-level block representations of Vital Watch and the central hub.

## Contents
- **Vital Watch Unit:** Sensor interface, ESP microcontroller, power regulation, and encryption system.
- **Vital Hub:** Power distribution, Ethernet and RS485 communication, and data forwarding to cloud/PC.
- **Power Management Section:** Battery → TP4056 → DW01 + FS8205A → AMS1117 → ESP32/ESP8266.

Each diagram is annotated to highlight both the power and signal pathways for clear understanding of the hardware architecture.
