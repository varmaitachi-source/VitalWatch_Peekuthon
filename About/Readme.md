# About Vital Watch

Vital Watch is a wearable IoT-based health monitoring system designed for real-time patient tracking in hospital wards and remote monitoring environments.  
It continuously monitors critical parameters such as heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, and temperature, and transmits the data to a central monitoring hub using the ESP-NOW protocol.

## Key Highlights
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** Enables direct and secure data transfer between watch nodes and the hub.
- **Hybrid Switching:** Seamless transition between online (cloud) and offline (local ward) modes.
- **Ultra-Low Latency:** Delivers health data updates in milliseconds.
- **AES-128 Encryption:** Ensures secure and tamper-proof data transmission.
- **Scalable Ward Monitoring:** Supports multiple devices communicating simultaneously with the central hub.
