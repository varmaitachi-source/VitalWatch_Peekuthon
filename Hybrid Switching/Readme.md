# Hybrid Switching Mechanism

The hybrid switching logic allows Vital Watch to operate seamlessly in both **online** and **offline** modes.

## Modes
- **Offline Mode:** Data transmitted locally within the ward using ESP-NOW.
- **Online Mode:** Data synced to cloud servers via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- **Auto-Switch:** Automatic transition based on network availability.

We are adding the signal repeaters across an area to increase the signal strength and to reduce the interfence from other machines

This directory contains test videos, switching logic flow, and code demonstrating the hybrid functionality.
